Downloading Gigapan Images in Parallel

Only to be used for your own Gigapan images, not to download others'

Influenced by the code here:
https://github.com/DeniR/Gigapan-Downloader-and-stitcher

##Usage

python downlaoder.py GIGAPAN_IMAGE_ID

Currently launches with 100 threads so you might want to change that on line 80 of downloader.py. Will be adding that as an argument soon
